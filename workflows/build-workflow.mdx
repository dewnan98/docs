 # üõ†Ô∏è Building a Workflow

Workflows in Impresiv are built visually using a node-based flow editor. You can connect triggers, logic, actions, and AI to create powerful automations in minutes.

---

## 1. Create a New Workflow

Go to your [Dashboard](https://impresivai.com/dashboard) and click **‚ÄúNew Flow‚Äù**.

Give your workflow a name and optionally a description to help you (or your team) understand its purpose later.

---

## 2. Add a Trigger

A trigger starts the flow. You can choose from:

- **Webhook** ‚Äî responds to external HTTP calls  
- **Schedule** ‚Äî runs on intervals (e.g. hourly, daily)  
- **Form Input** ‚Äî waits for user input from a form or chat interface  
- **Manual** ‚Äî for internal testing or utility flows  

Configure the trigger based on your use case ‚Äî for example, for a webhook you‚Äôll get a generated URL that listens for POST requests.

---

## 3. Drag in Nodes

Once a trigger is set, drag in new **nodes** to build your logic.

Common node types:

- **API Request** ‚Äî make external HTTP calls  
- **AI Action** ‚Äî prompt LLMs like OpenAI or Claude  
- **Condition** ‚Äî apply if/else branching logic  
- **Transform** ‚Äî modify data before passing it to the next step  
- **Output** ‚Äî return a value or send a message

You can add, connect, and rearrange nodes freely using the visual editor.

---

## 4. Configure Each Node

Click on a node to configure its:

- **Inputs** ‚Äî values passed from previous nodes or from the trigger  
- **Logic or Prompt** ‚Äî for AI and script nodes  
- **Headers / Params / Payload** ‚Äî for API requests  
- **Output Variables** ‚Äî values that can be reused downstream

Use **dynamic data references** (`{{ }}`) to pull in outputs from earlier steps.

<Note>
You can preview what data is available by hovering over the connecting lines or using the variable selector in the input fields.
</Note>

---

## 5. Test the Workflow

Click **Run** to test your workflow end-to-end.

You‚Äôll see step-by-step execution logs and output values for every node.  
You can make changes and re-run until everything looks good.

---

## 6. Save Progress

Impresiv auto-saves your flow as you build.  
You can always come back later and continue where you left off.

To make your flow available for triggering (webhook, schedule, etc), you‚Äôll need to **Publish** it ‚Äî we‚Äôll cover that in the next section.
