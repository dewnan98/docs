# 🔄 Passing Data Between Nodes

Each node in Impresiv outputs data. You can use that data in any connected node with `{{ }}`.

---

## 🧠 How It Works

- Output from one node becomes input for the next  
- Use `{{variable}}` to reference any field  
- Data preview is built-in

```text
Example:
{{trigger.email}} → sends to next node
⚙️ Use Cases
Inject values into API URLs or JSON bodies

Fill AI prompts with dynamic data

Add conditions: {{user.age}} > 18

## 🎥 Visual Example

Here’s a quick look at how data is passed from one node to another:

✅ Tips
Use the {} button to see available variables

Rename nodes so references are easy ({{step1.email}})

Transform data if needed using the script node
