# 🚀 Publishing a Workflow

Once your workflow works as expected, publish it to make it live.

---

## ✅ Why Publish?

- Enables triggers (e.g. webhooks, schedules)
- Runs in response to real inputs
- Saves your current flow version

---

## 🔘 How to Publish

1. Click **“Publish”** in the top right
2. Confirm changes
3. You’ll see a ✅ badge next to the workflow name

Now your flow is live and ready to be triggered.

---

## 🔁 Updating a Published Flow

Edit your flow anytime. Just click **“Publish”** again to push changes.

> Impresiv keeps the latest version active. You don’t need to redeploy anything.

---

## 🧪 Safe to Test

You can still test your workflow even after publishing.\
Just hit **Run**, use test inputs, or trigger it manually.
