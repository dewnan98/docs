# Data Flow Nodes

Data flow nodes let you control how data moves through your workflow. Use them to add conditions, loops, filters, and routing logic.

---

## If

Run one path if a condition is true, another if false.

- Input: expression (e.g. `{{user.age}} > 18`)
- Output: `true` or `false` branch
- Supports numbers, strings, booleans, and nested variables

---

## Switch

Route the flow based on a specific value.

- Input: expression or variable (e.g. `{{user.type}}`)
- Add multiple cases (e.g. `"admin"`, `"guest"`, `"member"`)
- Includes default fallback if no case matches

---

## Loops

Repeat steps for each item in a list.

- Input: array (e.g. `{{items}}`)
- Output: runs the child nodes once per item
- Built-in variable: `{{loop.item}}` refers to the current item
- Can also loop a fixed number of times or over last output

Use this to send multiple messages, make batched API calls, or process each entry individually.

---

## Filter

Only continue if data matches specific criteria.

- Input: condition (e.g. `{{email}} contains "gmail.com"`)
- Output: continues if true, skips if false
- Often used right after a trigger to clean data before logic
