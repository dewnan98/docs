# ⏱️ Trigger Nodes

Triggers are how a workflow starts. Impresiv supports multiple trigger types depending on your use case.

---

## 🔗 Webhook

Start a flow when data is sent to a URL.

- Method: `ALL METHOD SUPPORTED` 
- Headers and body supported
- URL is auto-generated when you create the node

Use this when integrating with external systems or tools that send data.

---

## 🕒 Schedule

Trigger your flow on a recurring basis.

- Interval options: minutes, hourly, daily, weekly
- Good for sync tasks, checks, or timed actions

---

## 🔌 Apps Trigger

Start flows from external apps.

Examples:

- Incoming message from WhatsApp, Telegram, or Instagram
- New row in Google Sheets
- New subscriber in Mailchimp

> Requires app integration to be connected first.

---

## 🧪 On Click (Test Only)

Manual trigger for testing flows inside the builder.

- Doesn’t expose a real endpoint
- Use to test downstream nodes quickly

---

## 🔁 Trigger by Node

Call a workflow from inside another workflow.

- Acts like a function call
- Pass data between flows
- Great for modular flow design

---

## ❌ Error Trigger

Start a flow when another one fails.

- Gets error info, execution logs, and flow metadata
- Useful for alerts, fallbacks, or auto-recovery flows
