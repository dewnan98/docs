# 📤 App Action Nodes

App Actions let you send data to external services like WhatsApp, Telegram, Google Sheets, and more — directly from your workflow.

---

## 📨 Messaging Apps

Send messages to users across multiple platforms.

- **WhatsApp**  
  → Send text, images, buttons  
- **Telegram**  
  → Send messages to channels, groups, or users  
- **Instagram DM (Business)**  
  → Send replies to conversations

Use cases:
- Auto-reply bots  
- AI chat assistants  
- Customer service automation

---

## 📄 Data & Forms

Update records, spreadsheets, or CRMs.

- **Google Sheets**  
  → Add new rows, update cells  
- **Airtable / Notion**  
  → Create or modify entries  
- **Webform APIs**  
  → Send collected data to endpoints

Use cases:
- Log lead data  
- Save AI output

---

## 🔔 Notifications

Notify users or teams via other platforms.

- **Email (SMTP, Mailgun, Sendinblue)**  
  → Send emails with custom content  
- **Slack / Discord**  
  → Post messages or alerts  
- **Push Notifications (OneSignal, etc.)**

Use cases:

## ⚙️ API Custom Actions

If an app doesn’t exist yet, you can still connect to it using:

- **HTTP Request Node**  
- Add base URL, headers, and payload  
- Auth options: API key, bearer token, etc.

This gives you full flexibility to talk to any REST API.

---

## 🛠 How to Use

1. Drag an **App Action** node after your logic  
2. Select an app and action (e.g. “Send WhatsApp Message”)  
3. Connect your account  
4. Map fields using dynamic variables (`{{ }}`)  
5. Save & run to test

---

## 🔐 Manage Connections

You only need to connect each app once.

- Go to **Dashboard > Connected Apps**  
- Remove or reconnect anytime  
- Credentials are encrypted by default
