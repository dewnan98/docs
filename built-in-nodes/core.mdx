# Core Function Nodes

Core function nodes give you full control over execution, custom logic, and external communication.

---

## HTTP Request

Send or receive data from any API.

- Supports: `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`, `PATCH`
- Add headers, query params, body (JSON/form/raw)
- Handle auth with bearer tokens, API keys, or custom headers
- Returns full response: status, headers, body

Use it to connect with services that donâ€™t have a built-in node yet.

---

## Code (Script)

Write custom JavaScript to process or transform data.

- Access all incoming variables
- Return new data or handle logic directly
- Example: calculate values, reshape payloads, sanitize inputs

Good for edge cases, inline logic, or mini utilities.

---

## Wait

Pause the flow before continuing.

- Set duration in seconds, minutes, hours
- Use for delays, throttling, or time-based logic
- Can be used between nodes or before actions

---

## Respond

Send a custom response back to the trigger.

- Use with Webhook or Execute Node
- Define status code, headers, body
- End the flow early if needed

Example: return `{ "status": "ok" }` after a webhook is received and processed.

---

## Execute Node

Call another workflow like a function.

- Pass variables into the target workflow
- Waits for it to finish and returns result
- Helps modularize your logic (like reusable components)

## Extract Page from HTML

Parse a full HTML page and extract content.

- Input: raw HTML or URL
- Output: structured text, tables, meta tags, or specific selectors
- Use for scraping, summarizing, or analyzing web content
