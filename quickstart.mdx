# 🚀 Quickstart

This guide will help you build and run your first automation with Impresiv in just a few minutes.

---

## 1. Sign in to Your Dashboard

Go to [https://impresivai.com](https://impresivai.com) and click **Get Started** or log in directly:

👉 [Open Dashboard](https://impresivai.com/dashboard)

Once you're in, you'll land in the **Flow Builder** — your workspace for building and managing automations.

---

## 2. Create a New Flow

Click **“New Flow”** and give it a name (e.g. `"Send AI Summary to Slack"`).

You’ll be taken into the visual builder where you can start adding nodes to your flow.

---

## 3. Add a Trigger

Every flow starts with a trigger.  
Choose from common trigger types:
- **Webhook** — start the flow via an external HTTP call  
- **Schedule** — run the flow on a recurring timer  
- **Form** — wait for a user to submit input  

Configure the trigger as needed — we’ll give you the webhook URL or options immediately.

---

## 4. Add Your Actions

Next, drag in nodes to define what happens:

- **AI Action** — call OpenAI, Claude, or other models  
- **API Request** — send/receive data from external systems  
- **Condition / If Else** — add decision logic  
- **Delay / Wait for Approval** — control timing or human input  
- **Output** — return a webhook response or send a message somewhere

Each node has a configuration panel. You can use variables from previous nodes to pass data along.

---

## 5. Test Your Flow

Click **Run** or **Send Test Event** (for webhook triggers) to see your flow in action.  
You’ll get real-time logs and can trace each step.

<Note>
You can modify and re-test flows as many times as you want before activating them.
</Note>

---

## 6. Activate It

Once everything looks good, click **“Activate”** — your automation is now live.

It will run on schedule or respond to trigger events automatically.
